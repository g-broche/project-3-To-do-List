ToDoList JS training

experimenting JS during training course and second small scale JS exercise (challenge RPG being the first one).
Project focused on making a to-do list. Uses a literal object acting as a database and consisting of an array in which are pushed task objects.
The implementation of a local storage save adds some form persistence until we starts messing with PHP and SQL database to handle the backend side of things properly for further projects.
